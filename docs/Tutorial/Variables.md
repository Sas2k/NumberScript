# Variables

## What are variables?

variables are like boxes, in these boxes you can store stuff, for later.

- Strings
- Numbers

## Defining Variables in NumberScript

Now to define variables we need to use the `3` command.

so how to works is like this

`3Variable_name:Variable_Value`

now you can call variables in the display to If-Else commands, or just by them-selves to display the value.

Example:
```
    0
    3name:NumeroMan
    2name
    1
```

You can also have calculations in the vars with `^` we covered in the Basics.

`3one_plus_one:^1+1`

or user-input with the `~`

`3Name:~What's-your-name?`

## Exercise

Now that you learnt the basics of Variables.
Here is an exercise to try it out.

### 1) What's your name?

Here is a very easy exercise.
Using the input (~), Try and make a program where it asks for a name then prints it.

```
What's_your_name?NumeroMan
Hello,
NumeroMan
That's a good name
```
