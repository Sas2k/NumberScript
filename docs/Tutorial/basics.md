# Basics of NumberScript

Now in this part we're going to cover the basics of NumberScript

## Part 1

Now in the NumberScript program there are 3 parts

- Start
- Code-Body
- End

So the start of the program is started with `0` and ends with `1`, The code body is in-between those 2

example:

`0 2Hello 1`

```
0
2Hello
1
```

Ok now we can mode on to displaying stuff.

## Part 2

ok, to display a string in the program we can use the `2` command.

`0 2Hello 1`

^In the above example it will print Hello

>Also remember don't add any spaces or anything to the string!

You can display output of basic math equations with `^`

> Can: +(add), -(subtract), /(divide), *(multiply)

`0 ^100+50 1`

this should display,

`150`

> Quick-Note: You can't have different operations in a single `^`
> 
>           : meaning you can do 1+1+2 but not 1+1*2
> 
>           : Also NO SPACES.

you can also display random numbers and set them to [variables](../Variables)

Example of displaying a random number between 1 to 5:

    *1!5

## Exercises

Here are some exercises to flex your new found knowledge

### 1) displaying a sentence

Here is your first exercise,
Try to display a sentence. using the `2`,

Examples of a sentence,

- Hello-How-are-you?
- Hi_What's_your_name?

### 2) Adding

Here is your second exercise.
Display 2 numbers then display the total (using `2` and `^`)

```
Number1:5
Number2:10
Total:15
```

ok, now that's finished we can move on to variables!.
