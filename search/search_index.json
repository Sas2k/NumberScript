Part 2 ok, to display a string in the program we can use the 2 command. 0 2Hello 1 ^In the above example it will print Hello Also remember don't add any spaces or anything to the string! You can display output of basic math equations with ^ Can: +(add), -(subtract), /(divide), *(multiply) 0 ^100+50 1 this should display, 150 Quick-Note: You can't have different operations in a single ^ : meaning you can do 1+1+2 but not 1+1*2 : Also NO SPACES. you can also display random numbers and set them to variables Example of displaying a random number between 1 to 5: *1!5 Exercises Here are some exercises to flex your new found knowledge 1) displaying a sentence Here is your first exercise, Try to display a sentence. using the 2 , Examples of a sentence, Hello-How-are-you?
